Party niggaz ideas

Users can log in to the site
Users can suggest other people to be allowed into the site
Other users can be allowed in to the site, but only once everyone else has agreed - until then, they don't get an invitation. Once everyone has agreed, they get an email notification to log in
As a user, I want everything on the Party Niggaz network to be easily transferrable to and from facebook, so I don't always have to log in to check events etc
As a user, I want to be able to check all the music shared bu other users, and check which party they were from if/when relevant
As a user, I want to be able to create events: trips, parties, sporting activities lol... these events should also be postable on facebook if I want
As a user, I want to be able to organise whip arounds for money for events, gifts, and such
As a user, I want to be see the destination to parties and events using the google maps API
Users can chat in a global chat, and filter by relevant messages: so if I'm talking about an event, I can easily tag it so it's filterable. If I'm just talking shit, I don't tag it
Users can access a calendar easily, to see all events
Note: I think the chat feature would bring the coolest added value?
Also separate tabs for music, pictures, etc
As a user, I want to see a much more beautiful picture catalog than facebook has to offer - but with the same tagging system, etc

Possible challenges

I don't know what Boris' idea actually is/was, maybe I'm on the wrong page
Most of this stuff is available on FB - how do we make something that offers stuff FB doesn't have?
